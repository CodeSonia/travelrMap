# UX

Before writing any code, I conducted user research and used Jesse James Garrett's User-Centred Design process to help ensure TravelrMap is useful, useable and provides value to both users and site owner.

# Strategy

## Goals
A travel web application for travellers to create a lifetime experience for themselves and others with less hassle. The website allows users to find their site of attraction conveniently and efficiently, by providing useful information and/or suggestions on places to visit based on the user's interests. Perfect for those who are looking to visit an unfamiliar city and enable them to _learn, discover, find new adventures and explore new cultures._

### External User Goal:
- Find the most suitable holiday destination to fulfil their needs.

## Product Owner Goal:
- Allow users to find places of attractions from TravelrMap so the website becomes a popular site in exploring new destinations. 

## Purpose
The project's purpose is to help increase the love of travelling by **removing the hassle of using multiple sources** to plan a trip and increase positive user experience, **by aiding their travel search with providing the right information at the right time**. 

![travel made easy with travelrMap](assets/readme_images/travel_made_easy.png)

Users should find the website application eliciting a positive emotional response, as it is intuitive, simple and most importantly fun to use!

_TravelrMap is an online application that allows users to easily find interesting places. This enables users to help plan their next trip by finding all of their information on one site._

### Why?

**TravelrMap will help change the way people think about travelling**

Why not inspire yourself with sites of attractions listed from the most exclusive locations, and help plan your trip!

## Buyer Personas

Before jumping to developing my wireframes and begin coding, I decided to do a bit of user research to help feed my user stories. I interviewed a couple of friends and family to identify their goals and expectations when they travel.

### User Interview 1: 
![User Interview 1](assets/readme_images/user_interview_1.png)

### User Interview 2:

To summarise:

## User Pain Points:

### Disintegrated planning and booking
<details><summary></summary> 

The internet has vast amount of information in how people can easily plan and book their travel. However, as travel sites and information has increased, so has the complexity of planning and booking a trip.

- It takes too much time and hassle to find points of interests when planning trips. As a user they'll have to visit various websites or applications to find their required details to make an informed choice.
- Feeling overwhelmed from having to navigate multiple pages and having to keep many tabs open, adding complexity to make a decision. This creates a negative experience for a user, as travel _should_ be a fun thing to do!
  - Nielson [1] research has found that:
    >Travelers spent an average of 53 days visiting 28 different websites over a period of 76 online sessions. 

That is a lot of time and effort for the average person to find their right travel plans. This can be further negative/painful for someone who is trying to plan an itinerary alongside a full-time career and family commitments. 
</details>

#### Mobile Booking
<details><summary></summary>
70% of millennials book travel activities on mobile sevices. Research from Google Consumer Insights find that more than half of South Korean and Japanese smartphone users research, book and plan their trips on their mobile devices! [2]

- If applications and websites do not operate on mobile, then user experience will thus decrease. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure TravelrMap is fulfilling this need.
</details>

### Not having the right information
<details><summary></summary>
As users can become quite overwhelmed, as pointed earlier, not having the right information at once can impair user experience when travelling - organisation of travelling should be fun, not hard work. 

Users like to ensure that they're accumulating the right information, i.e. weather, location, travel and, other's experiences and so on. 

It also means, that users would like to know someone else had an enjoyable experience, before making the choice. According to Tnooz [3], 95% of consumers read reviews before booking. This means if this information is not presented, value is not provided to the user.

## Business Solution:

- Build an informative website application which provides useful information for the users when planning to travel or wanting to feel inspired for their next trip.
- Allow users to share their points of interests with their friends or families.
- Instant adventure - modern travellers look for more flexibility when they're quite spontaneous while travelling, meaning being influences by weather or mood. TravelrMap will allow users to find points of attractions while on their trip to aid this.

## Values:

### Value for the User:
- Maximum time saved on finding and discovering places to go with reduced amount of hassle.
- Able to easily navigate pre-travel and during travel plans.
- Creating a sense of community of those who love travelling and who are planning a trip together. 

### Value for TravelrMap: 
- Increased brand awareness as a one-stop shop.
- Lead nurtuting.
- Be able to include a features booking whereby users are able to directly purchase when searching.
- Able to build strategic partnerships with booking.com, AirBnB, SkySkanner, hotel.com and so on.
- With increased traffic, can look to commercialise the website by selling advertising space. Also, devise partnership schems with attractions/hotels/restaurants to illustrate accurate information such as prices, promotional offers and booking availability.

_Please note, some of these values are more aligned for long-term goals for TravelrMap, as it will not be feasible to develop all of this at once. Please see below Strategy Table and Scope for more context._

# Scope 
As identified from the strategy table, it is not feasible to create every feature during the first development. As a result, I have listed 3 phases and identified what the minimum viable product is. This means, Phase 1 should be enough to satisfy TravelrMap's users and will have the opportunity to gather user feedback. 

This will also allow TravlerMap to excite users when new features are developed - it is an on-going process! Especially with AI and automation being at the forefront of technology it would be cool to develop the project further one day using AI and algorithms to help users make effective decisions when organising travel and exploring what destination should be next.

### Functional Specifications:
- TravelrMap (map feature)
- Contact Form
- Trip Details

### Content Requirements: 
This is important since "__Content is King!"__ which implies that the reasoning as to why people revisit your website again, if it is useful, relevant, accessible and digestible. 

- Mixed content such as imagery and text
- Minimal content 
- Large imagery/beautiful visuals
- Eye-catching slogans and tag-lines
- Creative design - illustration and animation the landing page will captivate users.

## Release 1: (Informative Stage)
- Navbar
- About
- Quiz
- Micro Animation 
- TravelrMap (map feature)
- Contact Form
- Mobile Friendly 
- Social media links 

## Release 2: (Extra Functionality)
- Filter 
- Enable Location Services
- Favourite 
- 404 Error Page
- Dark Mode

## Release 3: (End Product)
- Create an itinerary and finding an itinerary 
- Share & Connect 
- Registration/Dashboard
- Gamification
- Bookings 

The great thing about having a MVP and planned releases enables me to create a "WOW" effect. Therefore, as I unfold new features, new user experiences are created for the future. Thus, surprising users with incremental changes that have meaningful values.
